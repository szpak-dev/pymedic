# Lesson 1: Introduction to Python & Medical Data Use Cases

## Lesson Overview

This lesson introduces Python as a foundational tool for working with medical data. By the end of the lesson, you will:

- Understand basic Python syntax and data types.
- Learn how to represent and manipulate medical data using Python.
- Explore three common medical data problems: BMI calculation, glucose level categorization, and patient triage scoring.
- Write Python programs to solve real-world medical scenarios without external libraries.

## Common Medical Problems Modeled with Python

### Body Mass Index (BMI) Classification

BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It is used widely for basic health assessments.

**BMI Categories:**

- Underweight: BMI < 18.5
- Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 25
- Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 30
- Obesity: BMI ≥ 30

### Blood Glucose Level Categorization

Blood glucose levels help identify conditions such as diabetes or hypoglycemia.

**Fasting Blood Glucose Levels:**

- Hypoglycemia: < 70 mg/dL
- Normal: 70–99 mg/dL
- Prediabetes: 100–125 mg/dL
- Diabetes: ≥ 126 mg/dL

### Patient Triage Scoring

Triage determines the priority of patients’ treatments based on the severity of their condition.

**Simple Scoring Criteria:**

- Respiratory Rate > 30: +2 points
- Heart Rate > 120: +2 points
- Temperature > 39°C: +1 point
- Temperature < 35°C: +1 point
- Age ≥ 65: +1 point
